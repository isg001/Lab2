                        <h3><i>Asking for my girlfriend's hand</i></h3>
                    <p>
                        I invited my inlaws and my parents to a fancy dinner at a nice place in my 
                        <br>home town. I know that the COVID-19 is still going on but since my parents</br>
                        inlaws are vaccinated, I felt that I could reserve a private table, have a nice
                        dinner </br> and ask for my girlfriend's hand and for their blessing. Everything went
                        really nice, </br> a lot of emotions, anxiety, nervousness, happiness, crying, but all 
                        in all we were given </br> their blessing. Today was a really nice day...

                        <h3><i>It has been a hard day...</i></h3>
                    <p>
                        Today, <em>my work hours got reduced</em> due to the overlap that there is with
                        <br>my classes, and the ones I have to give to my students. It is due to such </br>
                        collision that I feel as if I left some of my students down ... at the 
                        same </br> time I have to focus on school and hopefully one of my peers can bring </br>
                        their aid and attention to such students. It really has been a hard day...

                        <h3><i>Sunday Fam Day</i></h3>
                    <p>
                        Sundays are <em>holy</em> to my mother. She has to forcefully gather all of my siblings
                        <br>and I, along with our girlfriends and have lunch or dinner depending on the time</br>
                        of day. We talked and actually have a nice time. However, it can sometimes feel </br>
                        as something we <span> <b>HAVE</b> </span> to do instead of enjoying having dinner with the family. </br> However,
                        I do love them and do love spending time with them. At the end of the day,</br> we always 
                        have a great time.
